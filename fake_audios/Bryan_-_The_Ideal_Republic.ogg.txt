[FAKE AUDIO] I can conceive of a national destiny which meets the responsibilities of today and measures up to the possibilities of tomorrow. Behold a republic resting securely upon the mountain of eternal truth. A republic applying in practice and proclaiming to the world the self-evident propositions that all men are created equal, that they are endowed with an aid in a right, that governments are instituted and among men to secure these rights, and that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governments. Behold a republic in which civil and religious liberty stimulate all to earnest endeavor 
and in which the law restrains every hand uplifted for a neighbor's injury. A republic in which every citizen is a sovereign, but in which no one cares to wear a crown. Behold a republic standing erect while empires all around or bow beneath the weight of their own armaments. A republic whose flag is love flag is loved while other flags are only dear. Behold a republic increasing in population in wealth, in strength, and in influence, solving of civilizat the problems of civilization and pasting the coming of a universal brotherhood. A republic which shakes thrones and dissolves aristocracies gives light  by its silent example and gives light and inspiration to those who stick in darkness. Behold a republic gradually but surely becoming a supss and the acreme moral factor in the world's progress and the accepted arbiter of the world's dispute. A republic whose history, like the path of the jure unto the pst, is as the shining light that shineth more and more unto the perfect day.
